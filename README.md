# Artificial Intelligence

In this repo, you can reach the codes that I will start from the basics and write at a professional level to improve myself in the field of artificial intelligence. In general, I will share my work in the field of artificial intelligence in health in this repo.

Data Summary :

The dataset has 2126 rows and 22 columns. There is no missing data in the data set. All values in the dataset are numerical.

Three classes are defined as target variables. These are respectively 1 : 'Normal' , 2 : 'Suspect', 3 : 'Pathological'. There are 1655 results from the Normal class, 295 from the Suspect class, and 176 from the Pathological class.

Applied Model:

An attempt was made to get results by training the XGBoosting algorithm. The F-1 Score table will be used to evaluate the results. The most important variables for the model will be decided by using Random Forest Algorithm.
